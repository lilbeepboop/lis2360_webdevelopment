<h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
        <p>Everyone should be taking steps to keep their facial skin healthy. The skin on your face is one of the most sensitive
        parts of your body. So it only makes sense that you must take steps to take care of it. Whether your routine is simple
        or elaborate, it will be worth it to do it daily. You will see a difference in your skin by sticking to a routine. </p>
        
        <p><br>The type of skin you have will determine what products you will use. There are three skin types. You can either
        have dry skin, oily skin, or a combination of both. No matter what skin type you have, you can work to have your skin
        looking beautiful everyday. For the most part, you will be able to figure out your skin type easily. If you are having
        a hard time figuring out your skin type, you can do the blotting paper test. The paper will help you figure out if parts of
        your face is carring oil or not. </p>
        
        <p>The are many different products to use on your skin. These products do various thing to help you in the ways you want them
        to. One product everyone should use is a cleanser. Everyone should clean their face twice a day. The type of cleanser you use
        will depend on your skin type. So find a cleanser you like and clean your face twice a day. Another item everyone should use is
        a mosturizer. A mosturizer will hydrate your skin and make it feel smooth. Everyone should have the habit of mosturizing
        twice a day. Another product that everyone should use is sunscreen. Sunscreen will protect you skin from harmful ultraviolet rays.
        You should applyu sunscreen in the morning. </p>
        <p>There is an order in which you should put on theese products. The order is very important when it comes to skin care.
        a simple example can be seen below. </p>
